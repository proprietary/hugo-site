## Can't find VirtualBox Guest Additions?

I encountered errors trying to install Guest Additions on Oracle VirtualBox for a Windows 10 guest. The application is supposed to download it and mount the ISO as an optical drive in the VM. But in my instance it failed to download. So naturally I looked to see if I could download the ISO separately. Oracle doesn't provide a link whatsoever, but luckily the site shows a directory listing here:

[https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/)
